# Sprint Meeting 1 (5/17/2019)

##### See our progress in our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/A29h9i9f/ecs153) board.

## What we did:

- **Kauana**

   Worked on the login and sign up screen using React Native ([commit](https://github.com/Wirdal/153Project/commit/f685b375b3c9f04a3c3738242b13e8898af7ee2a)).

   Set up Firebase so users can create an account and login once they have an account. We are currently storing only user's username (unique) so users can find one another ([commit1](https://github.com/Wirdal/153Project/commit/54eefaa8cb7f3a4f50dfdd7dbe50ed322d06bbd7)) and [commit2](https://github.com/Wirdal/153Project/commit/0f0b84f81d479ce6a849082f0a1e222de9c6be23)).
